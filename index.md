# Welcome to my Personal Page   

I'm a math student at University of Trent. 

### Education 

1. Bachelor thesis: "Metodi risolutivi per le equazioni di Pell" which is basically a
    ~\(40\) pages long essay on various method to solve [Pell'equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pell%27s_equation) and its generalizations. 
    A selected bibliography:         
        - [Barbeau, Edward J., _Pell's Equation_](https://www.springer.com/gp/book/9780387955292)      
        - [Murru, N., _Solving the Pell equation via Rédei rational functions_](https://arxiv.org/abs/1103.3762)         
        - [Murru, N., _A note on the use of Rédei polynomials for solving the polynomial Pell equation and its generalization to higher degrees_](https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.01837)    

### Side projects 

1. [PPP: Potato Pingers Pinterface](): a hand interface as a substitute to the cursor 
    while having not very clean fingers.        
2. [markov-chains](https://github.com/ladezai/markov-model): a toy implementation of 
    stationary finite Markov chains. 
    The `/example` folder contains an implementation of sentence construction based 
    on a dataset (which in that case is Shrek's script which, as everyone knows, 
    is an instant classic).         
3. [golf](https://github.com/ladezai/golf): a collection of scripts where I shorten the 
    length of a script to the shortest amount of characters.        

### Miscellanea

Why is your username `ladezai`?     

It sounds similar to 辣的菜 which means `spicy dishes`.
Because I love spicy dishes, although I hate wasabi, 
and chinese sounds fancy. Furthermore names, as well as usernames, 
are better when they are meaningless.
